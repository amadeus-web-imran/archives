# Peer Education and Feedback Form

 - Have you ever felt helpless as your child struggles to find focus, motivation and skill?
 - Do you feel stifled as a parent, unable to actively shape your child's emotional and mental development?
 - How would you react if we told you there were resources that would empower you to make your child self aware, functional, productive, conscious and happy.
 - What if the process of preparing for maternity / motherhood could already be geared towards bringing in a humane, productive and peaceful child into this world with all these qualities.
 - What if additionally, there were a parent cooperative that you could start / join to peer-educate children along with their friends.
 - Please take this survey to help you better understand your wishes with regards to yourselves, your children and their entire generation.
