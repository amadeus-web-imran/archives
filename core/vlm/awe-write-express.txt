# AWE, A Three Step Program

1. Absolute Wellbeing Enlightenment. 
2. Write Your Success Story 
3. Express Powerfully. 

# Module One

Absolute Wellbeing is based on Psycho-Spiritual Wisdom discovered by an MBBS, MD, PhD doctor. It is unquestionably the ultimate and lasting solution to overcome illnesses and the rising anxiety in the world today. 

Thousands who got insight into this Wisdom are free from the fear of all kinds of diseases such as Pandemic, TB, Typhoid, Malaria, Jaundice, Chikungunya, Diabetes, BP, Heart Blocks and Cancer. 
 
## AWE is a realization that

1. Life governed by Universal Energy. 
2. Life is beyond the physiological body. 
3. Whatever state we may be in, it changes. 
4. Wounds heal, disease reverse and life energy restores. 
5. It is the 'violated mind' that manifests symptoms of disease. 
6. Realizing and responding to the 'violations' sets everything right. 

Saify Saraiya imbibed this learning in 2006 and authored 'Zero Medicine Wisdom'. He now unfolds this discovery by offering it as a course titled: 'Absolute Wellbeing Enlightenment (AWE).

# Module Two

"Write Your Success Story" - Enhance your self awareness and learn to:

1. Listen to your inner voice. 
2. Declutter all that you don't need. 
3. Filter meaningless and misleading information. 
3. Understand and Crystallize what life truly means to you. 

The more you know yourself, the greater will be your self esteem and lesser will be your need for people's approval. 

In the words of Richard Bach: "Your only obligation in any lifetime is to be true to yourself. Being true to anyone else or anything else is not only impossible, but the mark of a fake messiah." 

To write about yourself, ponder upon:

1. What delights you currently in life and why? (passion) 
2. What would give you greater delight and why? (aspirations) 
3. The support and the effort you need to organize to succeed (mission). 

Writing a book on yourself can create a wonderful turnaround while giving you a vision and a sense of fulfilment in life. 

# Module Three 

'EXPRESS POWERFULLY and be the messenger of Truth'. 

One most vital factor needed for the success of a person is the ability to express. The way to develop this ability is not by just adopting a social personality but by realizing our true individuality. Social personality may enhance our self esteem, yet in actual life, real success comes from  'what we are' and the satisfaction we feel within, and not from what we project to the world or how the world sees us as. 

Training ourselves to give speeches is like practicing to perform on stage. Spectators get impressed, but the Speakers suffer from performance anxiety and their 'individuality' stays suppressed. 

'Express Powerfully' is thus a course designed from the best of three decades' experience. Our charisma gets dramatically enhanced as we begin to unmask and unfold our blindfolds. We allow our true self to express, actualize our real potential and impact the audience's heart.

This approach enables us to express ourselves without inhibitions. There is hardly any need to prepare and practice speeches, nor speak what we are not. We express what we feel, allow words to flow from our heart to touch the heart, share meaningful life experiences, learnings, convictions and thus move people into action. 

The course helps:

- Educators to teach better. 
- Executives to engage employees. 
- PR spokesperson facing the media.
- Overcoming fear of public speaking. 

Duration: Sixteen Online Sessions one hour each.
