# Aims and Objectives

 - We see humanity as One Family and so, wish to implement the following...
 - Spread "Absolute Well-being Enlightenment" and promote "Value Life Mission". 
 - Inspire the global human community through physical retreats and virtual workshops to live by these principles. 
 - Conduct advanced facilitator training for those who have imbibed the learning and have become the evidence of AWE.
 - The facilitators can then adopt a honeycomb model to compound the reach of AWE.
 - Mentor individuals to initiate the neighbourhood support groups to help them live in physical communities which they can harmoniously belong to.
