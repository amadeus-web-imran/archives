# Introduction

The objective behind **value life mission** is we must value all life. The very fact that we are experiencing this life and while we are experiencing this life via seeing and feeling - based on our feeling we're choosing, we are speaking and expressing, we are exchanging and that is how our conscience is expanding. Now as we are seeing - we are seeing other lives, the purpose of our life is to value all life and that is the objective with which the maker has created every living being to integrate with each other and value each other. This being the purpose we value the mission of **value life mission** which is being established. Now when we see the people with difficulty the people needy people in the road this disparity between rich and poor both rich and poor victims of their own reasons but they are living beings - they need shelter, they need space and if the maker is providing them the life we being their companions on earth, our duty is to behave as the attribute of the maker and support every life that we see this in turn enriches the soul.
