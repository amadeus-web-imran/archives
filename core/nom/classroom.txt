# Introduction

General guidance for any sort of classroom, specifically the ["CBE" class](../children/)

# For the Students to Know
## Class Habits

 - Keep Pencil and Journal at Hand
 - Don't interrupt, raise your hand
 - Try not to put each other down with jest
 - Work sincerely and the rewards will be manifold
 - Remember we are all here in this journey together

## Shared Responsibilities

 - Each of you will take turns summarizing the class and making reports on happenings and progress.
 - Homework submissions can be shared with the entire group by mailing nom1-cascade@yieldmore.org. Pictures of handwritten notes preferred.
 - one to keep track of time and gently switch us over a few minutes before the allotted time for that activity has lapsed.
 - If someone is absent, they may reach out to any of you to get a first hand idea on what they missed.

## Personal Goals

Since this is primarily a mentoring program, we will eventually discuss personal goals and learn to decompose them into daily tasks, activities and habits.

# Possible Activities

Classes could contain the following elements

 - Invocation
 - choice of prayer
 - homework review
 - 5 questions
 - songs discovered
 - journal discussion
 - one goal and how to plan
 - writing time
 - topic of the day
 - review of hour gone

# General Considerations

These may be done at the beginning or anytime when the teachers feel a lull.

 - Take everyone's pulse
 - How is everyone feeling?
 - Ready to have fun?
 - Anything exciting you want to share?
 - Anything that has you down?

# 5 Questions (activity)

Here, the children are asked to ask questions to the teacher*, keeping the following in mind:

 - Which you cannot usually find answers to
 - Which may make you shy or uncomfortable
 - Mention the outcome you want by asking the question
 - Timeframe in which to be answered

*Teacher to think of a related follow on activity.

# Assumptions
 - Children have the habit of journaling / are asked to develop it.
 - Reading as a habit to be encouraged
 - Children are asked not to feel restricted in this class
 - Parents plan a daily discussion time with their children and a follow on discussion with the parents group IS A MUST
