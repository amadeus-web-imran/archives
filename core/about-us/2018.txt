# Brochure Back
> I stand here today tired of divides and clutter and the negative. If one man can dare us all to rebuild the universe and another says "lets make the world work", then what more unalloyed joy than in trying?
>
> I'm far from knowing much but that didn't stop Jimmy Wales. So I say let's collaborate and give shape to our collective dreams - that of peace, knowing, loving and doing.
>
> Jnana, Bhakti and Karma, - the 3 paths to communion with the Divine Godhead within us all.
>
> We have a mission to complete, a new height to reach, a balance to be found - personally, as a community and as a species. Our's is just another movement in that direction.
