## Selling
Our most common activity

Companies sell products and services. Individuals sell ideas and promote themselves. Leaders sell visions of tomorrow. At all levels we are always selling something. A teenager is selling his dad the idea of buying a new television / video game. Information Architects sell technology stacks, libraries and coding styles. ISPs sell schemes and data plans. Teachers sell the prospect of turning us into worldly-wise and better people.

Selling is defined as "persuading someone of the merits of something"

## Inspiring Youth

This venture of YieldMore.org is a call to all adults to go back to their schools and colleges and create articles, videos and live presentations for the children to inspire them to discover themselves, gain healthier world-views, develop their skills and use their gifts to the full.

### What do you wish someone had told you back in college or school

 - I would say go within be yourself and follow your dreams with passion
 - Spend your time developing skills and character
 - Read more and learn about the world
 - Pass out with confidence, the ability to articulate your ideas and all round skills
 - If you can, acquire a taste for meaningful books movies and songs that will always stand you in good stead
 - Develop grounding and a moral compass
 - It's important to develop content.. when u pass out, pass out with knowledge..rather than with just marks and degree
