# Heal With Love

> DEEP AT THE CENTRE OF MY BEING there is an infinite well of love.
> 
> I now allow this love to flow to the surface. It fills my heart, my body, my mind, my consciousness, my very being, and radiates out from me in all directions and returns to me multiplied. The more love I use and give, the more I have to give, the supply is endless. The use of love makes ME FEEL GOOD, it is an expression of my inner joy.
> 
> I love myself therefore, I take loving care of my body. I lovingly feed it nourishing foods and beverages, I lovingly groom it and dress it, and my body lovingly responds to me with vibrant health and energy. I love myself therefore, I provide for myself a comfortable home, one that fills all my needs and is a pleasure to be in.

# Affirmations Program (Jan 2019)

It sometimes takes a lifetime to find that our purpose in life was a <b>life of purpose</b>. Whatever the purpose, pursue it with all tenacity. Then, over time, you notice, it changes. The dream I'm chasing now is not quite the same as I was 10, 5 or even 2 years ago.

If the core of what I am has not changed, then what has? <b>My perspective - the lens</b> with which I view the world. Am I a better worker, friend, confidante, teacher, son or citizen?

There cannot be any self development without ultimately a better developed society, and society cannot be said to be developed until there is a place for every last man/woman in it! <b>All for one and one for all</b> as Dumas put it.

We come in all sorts, with differing abilities and ambitions. Things around affect us differently. Some make us laugh, some make us cry. In the midst of it all, what do we focus on? Well, <b>anything that gives you comfort and courage</b>. Craftsmanship is indeed the order of the day. I say craft to underscore that every vocation, profession, hobby <b>has an element of the arts</b> in it. I've said before about artful skill and skilful art being the need of the hour. A need to <b>harmonize the 2 halves of our brain</b>. It is then that life takes on a <b>fresh meaning, full of colour</b> and wondrous sound.

Music can change our mood and ideas our convictions and thus actions. The process of evolution has been referred to as an experiment in neurolinguistic and phonetic programming, because it is words, ideas and sounds which govern us.

The best way to consciously program the subconscious is by tuning in to the <a href="https://www.brainsync.com/products/the-secret-universal-mind-meditation" target="_blank">"Secret Universal Mind"</a> - for this, there is a program by Kelly Howell of <a href="https://brainsync.com/" target="_blank">brainsync.com</a> that delivers on putting you in touch with your inner being, and watches as you come alive, living "a new wave of inspiration". A large part of what I am today is because I tried it and it worked.

Today we inaugurate our own [Self Made] "**Affirmations**" program. Meet any counsellor and ask them to help you change your thinking vocabulary. Remove the negative impressions and thoughts, think hard about your wellness in all facets namely Physical, Intellectual, Emotional, Spiritual, Professional, Financial, Environmental & Social. Lay out in clear words what motivates you, what your goals are, how your working to get them, what gives you peace of mind.

Then record these words and play them back to yourself everyday until your convictions are marrow deep / you feel it in your gut. The affirmations template runs as follows:

<ul>
<li>My core values are...</li>
<li>My values are...</li>
<li>I live for...</li>
<li>My qualitative goals include...</li>
<li>I am unique in that I...</li>
<li>My relation to a higher purpose or God is that...</li>
</ul>

When you affirm life, you will realize that <b>we live not alone</b>. We live in the lap of God. And God has many children, both sentient and non-sentient.

Thus, we discover the JOY OF GIVING. Of Sharing, Of Loving!
