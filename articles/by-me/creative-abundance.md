# Introduction

This was written in August 2020 viz on the 1st and 30th.

Gaia is the name we have chosen for our Abundance Series. Welcome, here we will listen lovingly to your story, offer a comforting hug to put a smile on your lips and stay by your side until you gush forth with gaiety and feel like spreading love like wildfire.

This month of August 2020 marks the beginning of my 8th year cradling a child known affectionately as YieldMore. 7 years ago [I wrote of the numbers of our bright ones and the effulgence of our Mother](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/brother).

That mother's name is Gaia, [defined here](https://www.gaia.com/article/meaning-of-gaia) as:

> Quite simply, Gaia is life. She is all, the very soul of the earth. She is a goddess who, by all accounts, inhabits the planet, offering life and nourishment to all her children. In the ancient civilizations, she was revered as mother, nurturer and giver of life. She goes by many names.

Tolkien [speaks lovingly](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/books/the-silmarillion/two-trees/) of her as [Yavanna Kementari](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Yavanna).

In this month I will record my ideas and articles on how you can colour your life as I try to do the same for myself and my family.

It all begins with a little journal. You can use ink, voice memos, a word file (I use google) or social media as you like.

---

In that diary, you can begin by sifting through the 12 aspects of our lives [outlined at MindValley](https://www.mindvalley.com/lifebook) and choose which ones form a healthy part of your life and which ones you would like to improve.

## Music

Tolkien, in his [creation myth](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/books/the-silmarillion/ainulindale/) describes angelic beings orchestrating the blueprint of creation using music. The Ainur are given free will with which to change the music, and so are we.

Don't feel trapped and isolate yourself. Breathe in deeply and let your pent up feelings come to the fore. It's alright to give in to a low and to cry. It's all a part of the healing process. No one knows why we are made to endure such hardship or suffer a lack of faith and bravado, but chin up - we CAN control how we feel and we can invest in things that make our lives better.

Music is condensed emotion and it can lift your any mood. I have [curated](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/curate/?o=0) [non romantic](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/curate/songs/school/) [songs](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/songs/) on YM Legacy which you can browse but I suggest you go down memory lane and find [gems that have moved / inspired you](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/pinkfloyd/comingbacktolife.html) to greater heights.

## Forbearance

I sometimes quail at the thought of all the goings on in my life that I can't control and feel stretched to the point of collapse but then find myself reaching out to a loved one who gives me the courage to go on.

The greatest quality one can possess is [titiksha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titiksha) or [forbearance](https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/religion-and-philosophy/spiritual-life/the-spiritual-power-of-forbearance.html) - [likened here to "shock absorbers" or the certainty that "this too shall pass"](http://www.advaita.org.uk/discourses/bapat/bapat05.html).

Life is hard I know and sometimes we don't know know where to turn. But invest in yourself and your future and watch slowly as life takes on fresh meaning.

Hang in there&hellip; you are special beyond measure&hellip; as this lady with the fork said "the best is yet to come".

## Support Circle

I hope you have friends and loved ones who can listen and make you laugh and hold your hand and offer a shoulder to cry on. Think who it is that makes your support circle, how they make you feel better, how you can repay them or pay it forward, helping those hapless souls who have no one to turn to.

## Our Future

If you need to heal, take your time. Remember every difficulty we overcome, we overcome as a species. We live in trying times where our nightmarish past struggles with our glorious future. Evolution is working its way forward, washing away the ill feeling of the past millennia until World War II took place, after which [evolution took a step forward](http://sasp.collaboration.org/Feb29.html), paving the way for the revolution of the 60s.

Remember as [The Mother](http://2020.yieldmore.org/media/books/mirra-alfassa/) said in 1914,

> The Lord has willed and Thou dost execute:
> A new Light shall break upon the earth.
> A new world shall be born
> And the things that were promised shall be fulfilled'

## Keep Smiling

> They say [you can see a hologram of the universe in someone's eyes](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/brainstorm/200806/george-carlins-last-interview?amp). That is most apparent when they smile.
>
> Don't for heaven's sake lose your positivity, your humanity or your passion&hellip;
>
> Live well - laugh often -love much? I promise you that mantra can come back to curve deeper wells in your being - increase your capacity to experience this little beauty called life&hellip;
>
> You will come out and blossom into the wonderful being I know each and everyone of you yearns to (and will) become&hellip; in your own way and at your own time. People around you can hasten or retard the process, but only if you let them&hellip;
>
> Don't let setbacks weigh on you for too long - experience all has some purpose - what we do not realise until time has passed and we can put things in perspective.
>
> Stay positive, stay focused, stay human, stay connected, stay in touch with your feelings and always remember as George Carlin said, that "life is not about the number of breaths but moments that take our breath away".
>

My mother smiles whenever I play videos of kittens. My grandmother's eyes would light up when seeing pictures of animals and [Charles](https://mash.fandom.com/wiki/Charles_Emerson_Winchester_III) would go into peals of laughter at the antics of Tom and Jerry.

Whatever causes you to smile, do! And often!

This is my diary, with my random ramblings. I hope in between my talking, that you have been filling yours.

Tomorrow we begin on affirmations and how to craft them.

# Consolidation

## Problems

They say you can either fight your way through a problem or you can bypass it by going around it. Instead of saying "I'm unhappy, what can I do about it?", try stopping analysing and scrutinizing your feelings, let go and "enjoy the moment".

> There is no such thing as a problem without a gift for you in its hands. You seek problems because you need their gifts.
> Richard Bach, Illusions, 1977

As the Garuda Purana says (see link below on control), we plan our lives to the finest details. I like to think we plan the outcomes and the details get fine tuned as the exact happenings play out with each others' improvisations to the script.

In this sense, the outcomes are like the gifts we seek and the problems (circumstances) come to impel us towards finding the solutions or give us the context to understand the meanings of what we want to learn.

## Life Purpose

As they say, "the purpose of life is a life of purpose". What more joy than to have a purpose in life and the inspiration to tread the path towards achieving that purpose.

Seven years ago I had a vision to build a knowledge base as a dear professor once asked me to. I felt what if we could collaboratively compile all the good and useful stuff, be inspired to explore the beautiful world out there, learn to contemplate within and express ourselves and our feelings? What if we were given examples of everyday heroes we could relate to and interact with and work beside? What if we worked to establish our dreams instead or reliving our nightmares? What if we could yield more and learn to live the life divine, a life where we lived and breathed as ONE collective?

That is the purpose. I'm yet to find the inspiration to effect it, the clarity of thought on how to achieve it, and the (dozens of) people necessary to make it a living fact. Inshallah or god willing, the days of waiting with uncertainty and doubt will soon be over.

What is your life purpose? Set aside ample time to find out and look around you to these heroes and their movements until you feel it in your bones intuitively.

Remember the progression Explore, Emote, Experience, Express. The journey begins with our keen observation and then finding something that we can connect with, something that moves us - that we can emote with. Expression is important for only then will we understand our purpose or what "[our verse](https://youtu.be/aS1esgRV4Rc)" can be.

## Strength of Will and Dreaming

They say, we magnetize people, things and events into our lives.

> The landing was perfect, a word I rarely use for my flying. A few minutes before the wheels touched the land, they brushed the tops of the grass, the soft gold whispering.
>
> Richard Bach, in [Illusions II](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2014/02/08/richard-bachs-new-spiritual-memoir-illusions-ii/).

Will is one of the "Gifts of Grace" - will and aspiration.

## Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan

> You are never given a wish without also being given the power to make it come true. You may have to work for it, however.
>
> Richard David Bach, Writer

I call that work BUILDING, for "thou art the author of thy [destiny](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/works/savitri/?find=destiny)". This means we do have control over our lives [as believed here](https://legacy.yieldmore.org/topics/death/garuda-purana/).

We are after all in "[Search for God](https://www.edgarcayce.org/media/10601/asfg-affirmations.pdf)", or as [Swami Sivananda](http://sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&section_id=1682) puts it - "Nature constantly moulds us into the image of God".
