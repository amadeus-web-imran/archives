# Social, Emotional and Ethical Learning

SEE Learning&reg; is a K-12 education program developed for international use, is the culmination of an academic collaboration that began in 1998 between Emory University and [His Holiness the Dalai Lama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Dalai_Lama).

Guided by a shared vision for an education of heart and mind, the program conveys a universal, non-sectarian, and science-based approach to bringing the ethical development of the whole child into education - an approach long advocated by the Dalai Lama.

SEE Learning provides educators with a comprehensive framework for the cultivation of social, emotional and ethical competencies; age-specific curricula comprised of easy to implement lessons; and a support structure for educator preparation, facilitator certification, and on-going professional development.

## From Wikipedia:

> In 2019, Emory University's Center for Contemplative Sciences and Compassion-Based Ethics, in partnership with The Dalai Lama Trust and the Vana Foundation of India, launched an international SEE Learning (Social, Emotional and Ethical Learning) program in New Delhi, India, a school curriculum for all classes from kindergarten to Std XII that builds on psychologist Daniel Goleman's work on emotional intelligence in the early 1990s. SEE learning focuses on developing critical thinking, ethical reasoning and compassion and stresses on commonalities rather than on the differences.
