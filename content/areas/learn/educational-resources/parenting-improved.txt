## From the website

> Hi there, I'm Bharath Ram Manoharan. I'm a Database Engineer, Parent, and an Aspiring Entrepreneur.
> 
> I write about parenting and relationships. I am addicted to improving myself in many areas of my life. That includes improving as a parent as well.
> 
> I turn to books whenever I want to learn. Writing and sharing about what I read helps me to understand the concepts better. As lovely and enjoyable as it can be, being a parent is a challenging thing. Many would agree if I said it is indeed more demanding than a full-time job.
> 
> I have so many questions.
> 
> To list a few,
> 
>  - How can I be effective in my career while being a parent?
>  - How can I raise a responsible, independent child?
>  - How to deal with potty training challenges?
>  - How to protect my son from screen addiction?
>  - How to teach my son to be strong and confident?
> 
> the list goes on...
> 
> I don't just believe in simply reading books. I take the strategies that make sense to me and try them out myself. This is the website where I share my results, opinions, feedback, findings, research etc.
> 
> If you like reading my articles, please sign up to my weekly email newsletter on the sidebar. You'll only get information that will either help you to become a better parent or how to make life slightly less stressful.
