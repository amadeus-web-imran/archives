This volume opens with Sri Aurobindo's small book The Mother, in which he describes the nature, character and role of the Divine Mother.

The rest of the volume consists primarily of letters on the Mother - on the Divine Mother and on Sri Aurobindo's collaborator, the Mother, who was the head of his ashram. He wrote most of these letters in the 1930s to disciples living in the ashram.
