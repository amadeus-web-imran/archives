ॐ गजाननं भूतगणादि सेवितं 
कपित्थ जम्बूफलसार भक्षितम् 
उमासुतं शोक विनाशकारणं 
नमामि विघ्नेश्वर पादपङ्कजम्

Om Gajaananam Bhoota Ganaadi Sevitam
Kapittha Jambuu phalasaara bhakshitam
Uma Sutam Shoka Vinaasha kaaranam
Namaami Vighneshwara paada pankajam

I bow down and surrender myself before the lotus feet of Vigneshvara (Ganesha).
O lord, who has the face of an elephant, son of Uma (Goddess Parvati),
who destroys sorrow. He who is served by the host of angels
and who partakes of the essence of kapittha and jambu fruits.
