# **#DontGrieveAlone**

Losing someone is tough, it raises a lot of questions. Will we be connected in the afterlife? Are they happy in the spirit world? So many feelings left unspoken... So much grief etc.

# 2015 Prayer (Rebirth)
Imran has <a href="https://imran.yieldmore.org/prayer-rebirth/" target="_blank">his own prayer (from 2015)</a> that tries to end on a positive note.

> Dear God,
> 
> We pray for all those dear departed souls.
> 
> May they have met the moment of death with calm and peacefulness and little or no discomfort, pain or trepidation.
> 
> May they have soon realized that they had passed away from us and not look back to us with sadness, attachment or regret.
> 
> May their short visit to the world between lives be full of courage, acceptance and daring.
> 
> May they not be lured into phantasmal worlds which are hard to come out of.
> 
> May they not be too harsh on themselves in judgement of their past birth and their actions therein.
> 
> May their time in purgatory / heaven / hell be adequate and productive.
> 
> May they choose wisely their next birth (or afterlife) and be granted your Grace.
> 
> May they once again become intimate with life's secrets, never forgetting, no matter the travails.
> 
> Amen
