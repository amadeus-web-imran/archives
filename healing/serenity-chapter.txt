00:00 Calmness of mind
00:01 is one of the beautiful jewels of wisdom.
00:04 It is a result of long and patient effort
00:06 in self-control.
00:08 It's presence is an indication of ripened experience
00:11 and of a more than ordinary knowledge
00:13 of the laws and operations of thought.
00:17 A man becomes calm
00:18 in the measure that he understands himself
00:20 as a thought evolved being.
00:22 For such knowledge necessitates the understanding of others
00:25 as a result of thought.
00:27 And as he develops a right understanding
00:29 and sees more and more clearly,
00:31 the internal relations of things
00:34 by the actions of cause and effect,
00:37 he ceases to fuss and fume and worry and grieve.
00:41 He remains poised, steadfast, serene.
00:45 The calm man having learned how to govern himself,
00:48 knows how to adapt himself to others
00:51 and they in turn reverence his spiritual strength
00:54 and feel that they can learn from him
00:57 and rely upon him.
01:00 The more tranquil a man becomes,
01:02 the greater is his success, his influence,
01:05 his power for good.
01:07 Even the ordinary trader
01:09 will find his business prosperity increase
01:12 as he develops a greater self-control and equanimity.
01:17 For people will always prefer to deal with a man
01:20 who's demeanor is equable.
01:23 The strong, calm man is always loved and revered.
01:27 He's like a shade-giving tree in a thirsty land
01:30 or a sheltering rock in a storm.
01:33 Who does not love a tranquil heart?
01:36 A sweet tempered balanced life?
01:40 It does not matter whether it rains or shines
01:43 or what changes comes to those possessing these blessings
01:47 for they are always sweet, serene and calm.
01:52 The exquisite poise of character
01:54 which we call serenity
01:56 is the last lesson of culture.
01:59 It is the flowering of life,
02:01 the fruitage of the soul.
02:04 It is precious as wisdom,
02:06 more to be desired than gold,
02:07 yea, than even fine gold.
02:11 How insignificant mere money seeking looks
02:14 in comparison with the serene life.
02:17 A life that dwells in the ocean of Truth
02:20 beneath the waves beyond the reach of the tempests
02:23 in the Eternal Calm.
02:25 How many people we know who sour their lives,
02:29 who ruin all that is sweet and beautiful
02:31 by explosive tempers,
02:33 who destroy their poise of character
02:36 and make bad blood.
02:38 It is a question whether the great majority of people
02:41 do not ruin their lives and mar their happiness
02:44 by lack of self-control.
02:47 How few people we meet in life who are well balanced,
02:51 who have that exquisite poise which is characteristic
02:55 of the finished character.
02:58 Yes, humanity surges with uncontrolled passion,
03:02 is tumultuous with ungoverned grief.
03:05 He's blowing about anxiety and doubt.
03:08 Only the wise man,
03:09 only he who's thoughts are controlled and purified
03:13 makes the winds and the storms of the soul obey him.
03:17 Tempest toss souls wherever you may be,
03:21 under whatever conditions you may live.
03:24 Know this.
03:26 In the ocean of life, the isles of blessedness are smiling
03:30 and the sunny shore of your ideal awaits your coming.
03:35 Keeps your hands firmly on the helm of thought.
03:39 In the bark of your soul reclines the commanding Master.
03:43 He does but sleep, wake him.
03:46 Self-control is strength.
03:48 Right Thought is mastery; Calmness is Power.
03:53 Say to your heart, "peace, be still."
