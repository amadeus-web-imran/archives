<blockquote>Conscious parenting is a term used by various psychologists (and others) to describe a style of parenting that usually focuses more on the parent and how mindfulness can drive parenting choices.

Put most simply, conscious parenting asks that instead of striving to "fix" your child, parents look inward at themselves. Conscious parenting views children as independent beings (though admittedly still developing over time), who can teach parents to become more self-aware. - <a href="https://my.yieldmore.org/post/conscious-parenting-is-a-term-used-by-various-psychologists-and-others-to-d--604342ecaf721105e8d8480b" target="_blank">Disucssion on YM Community</a></blockquote>

These are the development stages for a child from puberty/adolescence till they become a parent - dubbed "the journey to parenting". They may be in multiple stages at a given time.

<ul>
	<li>-10 = 12yo - 15 - puberty (physical), emotional identity and exploration</li>
	<li>-9 = 15yo - 18yo - relationships with the opposite gender</li>
	<li>-8 = 18 to 21 - physical and emotional maturity</li>
	<li>-7 = 21 to 24 - dating (relationships), engagement / marriage</li>
	<li>-6 and -5 = 24 -30 - spiritual, mental, emotional and physical health - family planning</li>
	<li>-4 = integral healing begins</li>
	<li>-3 = self awareness, societal awareness, world consciousness, purposeful living</li>
	<li>-2 = planning for conception, rudimentary preparation for receiving the light</li>
	<li>-1 = conception with light</li>
	<li>0 = natural birthing, oneness with nature, humaneness in birth</li>
</ul>
