#Serenity

Serenity is the name of the Health Journal of YieldMore.org. We feature articles by our healers who post often to our facebook group. See their <a href="../healing-events">Videos</a> and <a href="../healing-events">Events</a>.

When we say health, we mean not only physical and emotional health, but intellectual, professional, financial, <a href="https://legacy.yieldmore.org/religion" target="_blank">spiritual</a>, social and <a href="https://seamovement.org/support/" target="_blank">environmental</a>. A certain holism is involved in our integrated approach.

The <a href="../healing/">directory</a> exists to help YOU / YOUR FAMILY, COMPANY OR COMMUNITY grow into much healthier persons in touch with their emotions, desires and needs.
