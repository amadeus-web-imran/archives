O Lord of Mercy and love.
Omnipresent, Omnipotent and Omniscient!
We pray to Thee in all humility and reverence,
To help us in pursuit of knowledge
Under the guidance of our teachers;

Grant us an understanding heart,
Enquiring, fertile and balanced mind,
Faith, devotion and wisdom,
To concentrate on our studies fully,
Showing steady progress, day after day,

Make us phsically fit, mentally alert and spiritually secure
To follow the path of righteousness, leading on to Glory;
Free us from all perils and pestilence
Above all shape our conduct and character aright
To become worthy and eminent citizens.
