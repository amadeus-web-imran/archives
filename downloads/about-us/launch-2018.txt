coming again we want to crystallize this
04:45
idea that's been taken us anoint
04:48
endeavor but you are crystallized into a
04:50
progressive movement
04:52
Fortson spawns other movements building
04:54
around the three challenge of learn heal
04:55
and share and bring together like-minded
04:57
people okay one thing we are big on is
05:02
promoting the works that other people
05:05
are doing because we have this coexist
05:07
don't compete policy and we will we will
05:13
you know freely associate ourselves with
05:15
other organizations and ideas and people
05:17
and some of them while we are doing what
05:19
we do okay so this is the first life we
05:25
go with the tagline simply love loving
05:29
anything that you do love what you do
05:31
love the moments that you are in and
05:33
love the people around you okay
05:35
so learn he'll share those are the three
05:38
main channels under which our activities
05:41
are organized learn is all about
05:46
learning things about life as a as an
05:49
individual as a as a group and as as
05:52
humanity as a whole thread so it could
05:54
be learning about the sciences it could
05:57
be learning about art it could be simple
05:59
recreational activities it could be
06:01
learning new ideas things like that he
06:06
was all about healing health
06:08
relationships nurturing them developing
06:11
them healing conflicts of the mind
06:14
conflicting thoughts healing any kind of
06:16
conflict between different groups of
06:18
individuals healing health health both
06:22
both physical mental emotional and
06:24
spiritual threat and share share is all
06:28
about helping other people sharing your
06:30
time and resources with others which is
06:33
something we ought to strive for what we
06:36
don't always do so this is a reminder to
06:39
go out and try and make a difference in
06:41
all the circles you're in in the house
06:44
in the workplace within your
06:46
neighborhood
06:46
and within your communities cutting fire
06:50
in the world right only doing so far
06:54
loud enough Oh
06:57
okay okay okay fine so we are we don't
07:03
in the tagging that we commit ourselves
07:05
to personal growth and self-expression
07:07
intelligent people to discover the joy
07:10
of living inspired and purposeful lives
07:12
so there's life there's joy and the two
07:15
are always in sync
07:17
so we're tryna help people discover joy
07:19
in their lives and live inspired and
07:22
purposeful once if you go to this link
07:27
you see a list of all the things that we
07:30
do I can show you that later when I'm
07:31
demonstrating the site but let's move on
07:34
to the next slide okay so there's this
07:40
Latin sage Tempus Fugit which means time
07:44
flies tempers time Fugit fleeting flying
07:48
so it's a reminder that I'll stay on
07:52
this earth is brief and we have to make
07:55
the most of what we do okay
07:58
synonym of that is the other face carpe
08:00
diem which means with the moment seize
08:03
the moment seize the day because all we
08:05
are are a bunch of memories desires and
08:08
intentions all we carry into the beyond
08:10
are a bunch of impressions life we shot
08:12
lived well and leave behind good
08:14
memories thank you so I was when I was
08:24
discussing with friends what it is I
08:25
should talk about winner at the launch
08:27
and people said hey you know why don't
08:28
you talk about who you are what is it
08:30
that makes you run in Ghana right so a
08:33
little slide on that another at the
08:35
clouds life and I searched things for
08:37
what they are though I hope I can in
08:39
some way influence the outcome of this
08:40
wonderful stage of world growth and
08:42
development that we find ourselves in
08:44
right so I do many things for what they
08:46
are but I am hoping I can make a change
08:49
in the world around me and try and get
08:52
people together doing the things they
08:54
love right because we are in the midst
08:57
of human evolution as the writer likes
08:59
to put it I've always been a reader
09:02
there's no watcher I'm a curious mix of
09:05
all the wonderful ideas
09:06
being too in the books movies and sounds
09:08
that I've seen read and listen to the
09:13
places are being too through the eyes of
09:16
the writer standing on the shoulders of
09:18
giants the writers that care to come at
09:21
their views experiences and thoughts
09:22
thoughts on paper I believe curation is
09:29
the key to inspiring people not just
09:32
curating books but also creating ideas
09:35
articles and the works of other people
09:38
right so curation in the broader sense
09:41
curation gives people the healthy
09:43
worldviews bringing them closer to
09:45
perfection as Jamie Messina puts it in a
09:47
song it's all right here and the
09:51
pluralist who believes that all the
09:52
religions should be closer to visiting
09:54
state of love I recently realized the
09:56
word I was looking for was a
09:58
constructionist because I believe in
10:00
strengthening a person's the existing
10:01
faith because it's his faith that
10:04
resonates within himself and helps him
10:06
find the divine in his everyday so I
10:08
believe in strengthening bonds and ties
10:10
with people you will find my writing at
10:13
these three links I can read some of
10:17
them off for you later this is from the
10:20
brochure some short message I wrote it
10:23
goes to say that here I am standing
10:28
today tired of devising clutter and the
10:30
negative if one man can do so to rebuild
10:33
the universe and another one says let's
10:35
make the world work then what more
10:37
unalloyed joy then in trying I'm far
10:40
from knowing much but that didn't stop
10:42
Jimmy Wales the father of Wikipedia who
10:44
showed us once and for all that if man
10:47
is left to himself on his own he will do
10:51
the best he can and collaborate
10:52
collaboration is the biggest lesson we
10:55
learned from Wikipedia and it's through
10:57
cooperating that we can give shape to
10:59
our collective dreams the dreams of
11:01
peace knowing loving and doing knowing
11:04
loving and doing jnana bhakti and karma
11:07
the three paths to communion with the
11:09
Divine Godhead within
11:12
okay one moment
11:23
so this I believe that we have a mission
11:26
to complete a new height to reach a
11:28
balance to be found personally as a
11:31
community and as a species is just
11:34
another movement in that direction
11:35
outlined in this 2000 article for the
11:38
earth rather again which I can read over
11:40
your face later so what is yield more
11:44
data we are passionate people who
11:46
believe that the highest service you can
11:48
render humanity is to simply love love
11:50
whoever whatever and whenever living
11:52
always in the moment we believe in a
11:55
nobler and better life for all we're a
11:57
network of positive people commented to
11:59
personal growth and self-expression on a
12:00
voyage of learning and helping as a
12:04
social venture that puts perspectives
12:06
services and help at the disposal of our
12:09
visitors we believe in being a
12:12
progressive movement we're all set to
12:17
you know help both ourselves and our
12:20
leaders try to improve the quality of
12:23
their life somehow so we our quality of
12:25
life oriented we believe in healing
12:27
health and harmony education helping
12:30
people and we believe in doing it
12:33
through inspiration inspiration so on to
12:38
the next slide this thanks to Rahul is
12:42
the slide at being at back in September
12:45
you'll see it on all of the YouTube
12:48
videos it goes to the tagline inspire
12:51
curate promote and publish ok so what is
12:55
what is it that inspires us books and
12:58
music some of which you'll find on our
13:01
website the logical sound there was a
13:05
nice one there's this imagine right
13:08
imagine all the people living life in
13:10
peace you may say I'm a dreamer but I'm
13:13
not the only one I hope someday you'll
13:15
join us and the world will be as one
13:17
that's John Lennon from imagine so
13:20
sounds like that which kind of inspired
13:22
us we we don't we don't wanna index
13:26
20,000 songs on our website we want to
13:28
have the
13:28
the best ones the ones that we feel a
13:31
really worth passing on that can inspire
13:32
somebody help them you know grow in in
13:36
both an idea as well as an inspiration
13:38
and you know around to doing something
13:41
with their lives because carpe diem is
13:43
the message here that says hold on to
13:48
life live it love it right so that's
13:51
inspire and curate inspire curate
13:55
promote and publish so we do promote
13:58
other websites you'll see them you will
14:03
see them on our website freely promoted
14:07
under the channels here so anything like
14:09
this is a link to some other website in
14:14
this case the Overmind foundation oh
14:16
because Russell who teaches an
14:18
interesting effortless meditation
14:20
program you'll find you'll find all
14:23
kinds of information on our website
14:26
hang on
14:41
yeah so I want to go a little more into
14:44
detail on on the three listed under
14:47
share Santa building their broken good
14:49
country because before there was the
14:54
idea of a name yield or even born as a
14:56
became theta there was my exposure to
14:59
this lovely website Constanta dot o-r-g
15:02
somebody sparked the foundation in the
15:04
hague holland they believe in individual
15:08
development economic development
15:09
individual social development in the
15:11
projects jew below mantra and music a
15:14
they also have all kinds of ideas for
15:17
sustainable living empowering farmers
15:21
they have this publishing sister palsun
15:26
that produces books that asks us built
15:30
you know made sustainably they don't
15:32
have any impact on the ecosystem as a
15:35
whole
15:36
so that's on the spanda foundation you
15:41
see more this is the founder saga homo
15:46
dear friend of mine so how did he come
15:53
to choose the names panda well actually
15:54
he did a little bit about him his
15:57
philosophy and read somewhere that
15:59
spanner is the original primordial
16:01
subtle vibration that arises from the
16:04
dynamic interplay of passive and
16:05
creative polarizations of the absolute
16:07
and that by unfolding itself into the
16:10
energetic process of differentiation who
16:12
brings forth of all the creations heavy
16:15
thoughts i know but he wanted something
16:17
that meant vibration and vibration it is
16:21
what it is that makes us is this all
16:27
about the into period and that's
16:28
vibration for you so what the area is a
16:31
focus of the spanda foundation
16:33
well they focus on culture education
16:35
health in a hand
16:37
economics and research
16:48
I can play the videos again later here's
16:54
another guy Simon who start the good
16:57
country index five six years ago they
16:59
recently published a third version of
17:03
the index which writes Colin as the best
17:07
country in the world not so much for
17:09
what it does for its own citizens all
17:11
countries try to do that but they try
17:14
and rate it based on how much you can
17:15
treat us for another country which is
17:18
what I think we should all be about how
17:20
much are we doing to help somebody else
17:22
to be happy somebody else come up in
17:24
life somebody else find peace in what
17:26
they do right so that is what Simon
17:30
stands for I will quickly play you
17:36
though ultimately walk you through the
17:40
PPT that I made from their website last
17:43
year so Simon had worked with the heads
17:50
of state of different garments over the
17:52
last 20 years helping them engage more
17:54
productively and imaginatively with the
17:56
rest of the world
17:57
he and his good country index
18:01
co-organizer co-founder son of another
18:06
initiative called place grant observing
18:08
which is an area I'd like to find out
18:10
more about data to as I we try to apply
18:13
branding in a meaningful holistic way to
18:18
the people cultures and cross-sections
18:20
that we encounter and work with so I
18:24
mean that good country it was some his
18:27
experience of working with Sony this is
18:29
country cities and regions that their
18:31
country was born in June 2014 he gave a
18:35
TED talk title which country does the
18:37
most good for the world and now works on
18:39
that full time so why why do we need a
18:43
good country index where do we need an
18:45
idea for a good country because we need
18:47
to blend into one world that is what we
18:52
are there for now the case thrown away
18:53
the hangover the Dark Ages started
18:56
living in this new age of reason
18:58
light movement with me we should come
19:01
together on on world issues in our
19:04
science on them together try and help
19:05
one another so most of the world's
19:09
problems are just symptoms of a bigger
19:10
underlying problem that we haven't yet
19:12
worked out how to organize ourselves as
19:14
a single species inhabiting a single
19:17
planet this can change when we tell our
19:19
leaders that the old ways in which these
19:21
two democracies are no longer in fashion
19:24
that they need to think of new ways of
19:27
being creative and what they do and take
19:29
their responsibilities not just to their
19:31
own citizens but to all global citizens
19:33
more seriously right
19:35
so the need of the other is responsible
19:37
governance the good country like the
19:42
authority exists to change how our
19:44
leaders run our countries by changing
19:46
their perceptions on how countries ought
19:48
to be run to help them understand that
19:50
they're responsible for every man woman
19:51
child and animal on the planet and to
19:54
help them act like they mean it so any
20:01
leader who isn't prepared for this level
20:03
of responsibility shouldn't be leading
20:05
and here again I took some inspiration
20:07
from them is it just like your book what
20:10
it is is an organisation and NGO charity
20:13
or a company with an idea I said
20:14
yesterday I wanted for you more I didn't
20:17
want to exist on paper as just another
20:19
NGO trying to collect money to do
20:22
something I wanted to exist as an idea
20:23
that embraces and makes connections with
20:27
other people with other ideas that ought
20:30
to be shared again it's not just me I'm
20:33
just starting all of this I want people
20:36
to just join in and say hey man I like
20:38
the general tone of what you're doing
20:40
this is where I feel we should go and do
20:42
stuff and then we go ahead and do it
20:44
right so that's on the good country
20:49
coming back to our third inspiring
20:56
person founder of the building their
20:59
group whose audacity of dreams is out
21:03
today or is being is being released
21:06
today
21:09
[Music]
21:12
so that's his vision for this nation
21:15
great
21:15
how by building citizenry consciousness
21:18
in our citizens and children and through
21:20
to our children their parents and all of
21:23
them how we can try and bring about a
21:26
change in like a paradigm shift in how
21:29
we keep our responsibilities as citizens
21:32
how we take the responsibilities to one
21:34
another as people how we think of the
21:37
development of our children and eco
21:41
thought equal that was an idea he
21:44
discussed with me if you want to go
21:46
which is all about getting children to
21:48
think about the environment and through
21:50
them slowly winning the day and making
21:53
that you know magnify into into a
21:55
countrywide movement so that's Vera's
21:59
Omaha posture of the Brit India group as
22:01
a dear friend of mine
22:02
so the Biddinger group was founded back
22:05
in 2006 ah 2008 2008 they prefer a
22:14
simple exercise to be done by students
22:16
across the country keeping them keeping
22:18
in their minds of you that they should
22:22
okay keeping in view the spirit of
22:25
fundamental duties students write a
22:27
pledge open signatures of their parents
22:29
reciting them in unison in a charged
22:31
ambience committing to be good citizens
22:33
as they submit their sign pledge to the
22:36
school authority the effect as he puts
22:38
it is magical so what is this pledge to
22:43
the build India group has contributed to
22:45
our collective knowledge it runs as
22:48
follows we the people of India today do
22:51
solemnly pledge ourselves to the service
22:53
of our nation with honesty sincerity and
22:56
commitment always keeping our nation's
22:58
interests paramount and all that we
23:00
think do or say for the greater glory of
23:03
this land of this land so a normal part
23:10
of our
23:11
these organizations because I believe in
23:14
what they do and I guess I guess I guess
23:21
first need to be internalized so you'll
23:26
find me using the word I whereas I hope
23:28
in a few months it's going to be week
23:30
and there's going to be a whole lot more
23:32
people joining this moment right so this
23:37
is a reason for the building a group
23:40
that could go you know cross cross
23:45
country cross how do you have cross NGO
23:48
civil society really because that's what
23:51
they are a platform for spreading values
23:54
and attitudes the faster oneness
23:56

23:59

24:16
world's largest democracy it falls on us
24:18

24:20
solution acknowledge conditions that
24:21
affect us all media's Indians also have
24:26
the duty of unveiling to the world the
24:27

25:18
ideas from other organizations one
25:21
reason people that you know right
25:22
because that's what we are just all
25:25
coalescing into this one world that so
25:28
many people have that don't and envision
25:32
so much in the past how I'm going to
25:37
this what maybe later I will record a
25:42
video and send it out to you guys but
25:43
these are some values I will came up
25:49
with couple of years ago
25:51
so coming back to the last thing on my
25:55
rock you inspire curate promote and
25:58

26:01
books we publish articles and structures
26:07
sales we have a media library where we
26:11
have AP threes and in time you have to
26:14

26:19
subtitle file was for movies you want to
26:21

26:22
right so all that you will find on our
26:25
website this is what we have on the
26:31
parent site right now we have books we

26:43
prose and poetry and articles there are
26:46
some letters and speeches organizations
26:50
people foreign Stratasys programs songs
26:55
place for other people to voice their
26:57
thoughts recently we started adding
27:01
[Music]
27:03
transcripts of videos and presentations
27:05
made with a paradox and then random
27:09
information
27:10
on different topics and lastly movements
27:14
so any cause that you feel passionate
27:17
about any cause that you feel is worth
27:19
spending time on or sharing do let us
27:22
know and we you know add it up in the
27:24
relevant movement or create one for you
27:27
so this is on the overview page so
27:33
something in other community yield
27:36
monitor is a content portal which should
27:39
be post inspiring and useful information
27:41
from the internet and encourages people
27:43
to express themselves as a network of
27:46
passionate people who believe in
27:47
affirming life sailing on that voyage of
27:50
discovery and sharing as a social
27:52
experiment a learning and thought
27:54
sharing platform and a repository of
27:56
information so what's the general
28:04
formula in what we try to do we try and
28:07
find something inspiring we try and find
28:09
people who we can inspire we build a
28:12
network of people create a forum for
28:14
discussion we have a backing website
28:17
that says hey this is all the
28:19
information we've gathered present it in
28:21
the neat concise well edited manner the
28:26
way Wikipedia dips factual information
28:28
we want to do for inspiring and useful
28:30
information right so that's where the
28:32
website part comes in but we don't want
28:34
to just be this idea bag in the ground
28:37
we want us to ask I don't do activities
28:40
that we do activities through
28:42
interaction creation of ideas creation
28:45
of articles and the promotion of
28:46
programs so the technologies we use our
28:51
WordPress biblia Google Groups and
28:53
YouTube and this is what the website
28:58
looks like this is this is this a random
29:05
picture of the earth this is the chat
29:07
feature these are software buttons
29:13
people to the top side bottom of the
29:17
fine Peter these are the menus that we
29:20
have learned here is helping the main
29:22
things for now and here this example of
29:29
a search made on the book Jonathan
29:34
Livingston Seagull better serve up the
29:36
searching for the word slight and you'll
29:38
see every paragraph I liked it any
29:43
paragraph where the water kills given
29:45
the context and the word anything so
29:47
this is the kind of technology
29:49
improvements were seeking to attain in
29:52
the website we will write one moment I
30:03
just play this video quickly which I
30:06
made last year this is a movement we
30:10
showcase ideas articles and books that
30:12
about sharing but trying to build global
30:14
network of militias and forward-thinking
30:16
people we do this by inspiring people to
30:19
learn heal and share thereby improving
30:21
the quality of their lives to express
30:23
themselves and help their fellow beings
30:25
we live in a world that is headed back
30:27
to the golden age if only we would live
30:29
off our pettiness and ignorance not
30:31
worry every decade since the
30:33
revolutionary sixties has shown us
30:35
increasing our ability to love and think
30:36
of the well-being of one another cause
30:38
is just
30:40
the direction a crisis is not a modern
30:42
one but an evolution t water that's why
30:44
we promote programs like dancing dr.
30:46
sound approach to conscious evolution we
30:48
also promote outdated forms of medicine
30:50
and healing we encourage people to tell
30:52
us what's helped make their lives better
30:53
but it's about practice like meditation
30:56
or leading an active lifestyle content
30:58
on our website is arranged into
31:00
subdomains don't even share each will
31:02
have topics lists of places and people
31:04
who can help improve the quality of life
31:06
this could be educators counselors as
31:08
years since shares are about helping
31:11
people places like our furnaces and
31:13
hospices wouldn t listed here not sure
31:15
what we do we are a network of people
31:18
passionate about life and who want to
31:20
share what has worked for us this could
31:22
be best summarized in books curating
31:23
songs for children making videos on how
31:25
we have gone out to the minute
31:27
day-to-day problems we promote the works
31:29
of people who are already making a
31:30
difference in their servants there are
31:33
also those first will come out to help
31:34
others and those that need help
31:35
everything we ask people to do we ask
31:38
them to keep in mind we serve our best
31:40

31:43
them from us and present and go help
31:45
