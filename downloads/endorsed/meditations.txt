<blockquote><strong>How to Program Yourself to Success at a Cellular Level</strong>
Traditional transformation strategies address the conscious and subconscious repositories of belief, often quite successfully. But far beneath these intellectual planes, your cells maintain the memory of that original belief. To truly, permanently change your life for the better, you must learn how to communicate at the cellular level. Otherwise, you are doomed to remain stuck in negative patterns.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Secret Universal Mind Meditation

<strong>Increase your attracting force
Accelerate manifestation
Attract what you need and desire</strong>

The Secret imparts the sacred truths spiritual masters have taught for millennia. The Secret is real and powerful. It starts by changing your belief system, slowly, subtly and gently while you sleep. As you are lulled into blissful slumber by music enhanced with Delta binaural beats, The Secret is whispered into your ears--first audibly, and then just below the level of consciousness. 

Over days and weeks to come, your conscious and your subconscious mind will accept The Secret as true. Without knowing how or why, everything you need and desire will come to you through communing with the Universal Mind. Over the last half century, science is proving the existence of the Universal Mind, and now the Secret is yours to use. When you know and accept the Secret, you have the secret to everything: unlimited health, abundance, success and joy. 

With this guided meditation and subliminal messaging program you will overcome limiting, outmoded beliefs that have hindered your ability to create the life you've always wanted. While Delta waves gently lull you to sleep, The Secret meditation re-programs your mind with new knowledge and beliefs that unleash your power to create a new reality - a reality that fulfills your deepest needs and desires. 

Through nightly listening and brainwave entrainment technology, your subconscious will accept the information it receives as true. When this happens, what you need and desire comes to you. And there's nothing you need to do except relax and listen. If you fall asleep while listening, that's even better; the messages are still absorbed into your subconscious. The results are profound.</blockquote>
