00:00
hello Prem thanks for joining us aloo
00:05
England
00:05
thank you very so okay that's a clock
00:12
fun to say hey it is around towards that
00:16
way
00:17
so can you tell me a little bit about
00:20
what we are doing here Oh interesting
00:24
soon this is actually weekly off and I
00:28
think people can have a chat what is the
00:32
beeping what is it stand for you beamed
00:35
adversity eat more for few years so it's
00:39
interesting that I'm here now to ask a
00:41
few questions to know a little bit more
00:42
about words what is it that you've been
00:47
working on with our students and in
00:50
shimane equations from my opinions or
00:53
whatever yeah I'm getting a bit too
01:05
villain using run oh sorry
01:11
can I see the chippy finally okay so
01:18
that is that's me five years ago when I
01:23
was growing my hairs so this is actually
01:29
a picture of me at a very pivotal time
01:33
in my life when all the ideas although
01:35
aspirations I had were coming to the
01:38
fore and coalescing into what has now
01:40
become the website yield more daughter
01:42
oh right the time when it was happening
01:53
yield more for me okay so I'd have to go
01:58
back to school okay in Chania with the
02:00
earlier our motto was keep smiling and I
02:04
was born with a good smile excuse know
02:08
how to make use of it properly but that
02:11
was one thing
02:15
can you put headphones on otherwise my
02:17
I'm echoing I am you are on headphones
02:22
okay yep then I wonder what that is
02:26
anyway so yeah I went I went seven years
02:30
in a school which said keep smiling and
02:31
then I went seven years to another
02:33
school which said service with a smile
02:35
right
02:36
but I didn't search I didn't start
02:39
thinking about changing the world until
02:41
I was in college until then I've grown
02:45
up like any teenager in love with his
02:47
music in love with his bike rides off to
02:49
the beach and hanging out with friends
02:52
and playing sports I was that typical
02:54
guy but I was also very lucky in that I
02:58
had never seen too much sorrow I had not
03:03
seen the rough side of life so I grew up
03:05
kind of positive kind of happy and I do
03:09
believe that some of that positivity
03:11
reflects in my writing today this okay
03:15
and I think I've been thinking about
03:19
this right because I said lady under a
03:22
school that said service with a smile
03:23
because it was part of the mother save a
03:25
certain never taught us on the saddest
03:27
part they never taught us they didn't
03:32
say hey you know here's an old-age home
03:33
why don't you kids go out on a Sunday
03:35
and you know spread some of your cheer
03:37
here or get into some kind of recycling
03:40
or Civic sense or this and that I'm not
03:42
saying I'm not faulting them on it but I
03:43
did have this crib in my mind a couple
03:45
of months ago they master I wrote the
03:48
keep smiling article and the answer to
03:52
that which I realized a few days back is
03:54
if we had been taught service it would
03:59
have been an imposition in say I'm in
04:03
the position where I had the motto
04:06
it was only mine or my parents failing
04:09
to make us reflect on the motto and
04:12
today when I rediscovered it I'm
04:14
discovering it fresh right without even
04:17
the altruistic predisposition being
04:20
programmed into you restoring service
04:23
afresh
04:26
and I was thinking about a friend of
04:29
mine who was conditioned into service
04:32
and he's now at a point where he's
04:35
rebelling from it a bit so I said rather
04:38
you start late but take a bit on your
04:41
own terms in your own terms and to have
04:42
any kind of conditioning foisted on you
04:46
right and why am I talking about service
04:49
is because year more is my way of giving
04:52
back to the people who have supported me
04:57
giving back I'm giving back love to
04:59
someone who nurtured me whether it's a
05:01
parent whether it's a friend whether
05:02
it's a teacher right I'm giving love
05:04
back and I'm in somewhere trying to make
05:07
them proud that I'm building something
05:08
that's for people teachers or a parent's
05:14
greatest joy is in knowing that their
05:16
children Awards have made something for
05:19
themselves absolutely right and I don't
05:26
know I was I've seen the movie Dead
05:29
Poets Society maybe four or five times
05:31
in my life and in 2012 I miss a special
05:39
girl and I told her about it and I said
05:41
hey you know what this is my favorite
05:42
line from the movie and it's the line
05:46
with Robin Williams says o me o life of
05:51
the questions of these recurring blah
05:53
blah blah blah blah
05:54
what was amid this o me o life the
05:57
answer that you are here that you have
05:59
something to do and he says what will
06:01
you always be right so yield more for me
06:06
has been a five year journey in which I
06:08
say guys this is my verse I'm not saying
06:12
who should do what decentralized is one
06:15
of the things built into in one minute
06:25
decentralized is one of the values built
06:27
into it but what will you always be
06:32
right so this is the poster I made some
06:39
I'm not sure if it was 2012 or 13 or 14
06:42
or 15 but some time ago this is wait 16
06:51
because I'd only made this prayer a few
06:54
months before that right this is the
07:00
picture of Mount Kailash for those of
07:02
you who don't know there's there's two
07:05
there's two things I chose that I felt
07:08
gave the right vibe
07:10
one is the hem make me a channel of your
07:12
peace which you will see here you want
07:16
me to read it out
07:18
okay so it says make me a channel of
07:22
your peace where there is hatred let me
07:25
bring your love where there is injury
07:28
your pardon Lord and where there is
07:30
doubt through faith in you but there is
07:34
despair in life let me bring hope where
07:36
there is darkness only light and where
07:39
there is sadness ever joy right then he
07:44
says something about consoling something
07:46
about understanding but finally it is to
07:48
be loved as to love with all my soul
07:52
right so that's that's the challenge in
07:57
life can you love every moment of it
07:59
whether it's up or down whether it's I
08:02
mean they say they finish commerce or
08:06
marriage action without thought for its
08:10
reward or to renounce the fruit of
08:15
action of Allah so you're supposed to
08:19
renounce the fruit fruit of the action
08:21
what they don't say is actually you need
08:24
to love with detached attachment the
08:31
detached part is the trick right you can
08:33
love and then now you get to attach to
08:36
it right so yeah to be loved as to love
08:38
with all your soul and it's funny I'm
08:40
talking to a guy whose name is love
08:51
when we were talking about how then we
08:54
believe their facets of love could be
08:58
metallic versions of love okay
09:00
and some of this they met the season
09:10
working keep forgetting that Elvis
09:12
actually Lucien don't tell me these
09:19
facets it's it's a it's actually a
09:23
sleazy which like like you mentioned in
09:27
fact the attachment which is very like
09:30
information see that I will love this
09:32
first because the mi life but love this
09:35
person who feels like if it does come
09:38
back the basic fact feeling of just then
09:46
since when I just wanna know it is with
09:50
sting because it is the it is Annette me
09:55
happy
09:55
thanks speaking about love I remembered
10:03
that into in March when I made the
10:11
brochure for the first time I change the
10:15
tagline of the website from think good
10:21
to simply love I don't know if you
10:35
remember this cartoon do you which ready
10:39
Captain Planet yes a right so yeah I up
10:47
all the people that I support and the
10:51
categories I was just putting it on the
10:53
brochure because one of the values I
10:55
discovered or rediscovered along the way
10:58
of this five-year journey was that we
11:00
are not trying to compete with anybody
11:03
right someone asked me to lunch why the
11:05
hell are you wasting it I'm talking
11:06
about or three other people though I
11:07
said no these are people who I share
11:09
vision with then these are people who've
11:12
inspired me who I'm hoping to inspire in
11:14
some way in some day right
11:17
so I'm gonna read up this piece I wrote
11:22
for the brochure yeah okay it says it
11:28
was I learned here today it goes I stand
11:41
here today tired of divides and flutter
11:42
and the negative if one man can dare us
11:45
all to rebuild the universe and another
11:48
one says let's make the world worse then
11:50
what more unalloyed joy than in trying
11:53
so that one man who said let's rebuild
11:56
the universe was research box he said he
12:01
was gonna rebuild the universe in the
12:03
jacket of a book called furious lives
12:06
and the guy who says let's make the
12:10
world worse is actually Simon Anholt
12:12
he's founder of the good country way and
12:24
the way to do that is by simply loving
12:28
you love your children love your
12:31
fantasies love your recreation simple
12:36
right
12:36
anyway I went on then to say that I'm a
12:40
small man simple man far from knowing
12:42
much but that didn't stop the likes of
12:44
Jimmy Wales so what did Jimmy Wales
12:47
teachers we learned that man the fear
13:00
when Wikipedia started was that people
13:02
would come and they would screw up
13:03
things deliberately right so there was
13:07
no trust in the collective action of man
13:12
and we proved that no guys we can build
13:15
something special
13:16
if
13:17
we collaborate so faith and
13:19
collaboration with the two things that
13:21
Wikipedia taught us on this journey
13:24
so I say let's collaborate and give
13:26
shape to our collective dreams our
13:29
collective dreams not just yours and
13:31
mine but that that farmer is starting to
13:34
make a living wondering whether he
13:35
should sell half his crop try to put her
13:38
son through engineering or get him
13:40
married we're talking about everybody
13:41
right collective dreams that of peace
13:43
knowing loving and doing peace knowing
13:49
loving and doing so knowing is jnana
13:54
loving is bhakti and doing is Karma
13:57
right right
13:59
so jnana Bhakthi and karma are the three
14:02
paths to communion with the divine
14:04
Godhead within us all right Raja Yoga is
14:09
just so talk of the practices the
14:13
individual practices that a person needs
14:15
but this is the beauty right Indian
14:18
religion never said that these paths
14:20
were exclusive it is just that over the
14:23
dark ages we kind of got gardener taught
14:27
and we said over there is jnana that
14:29
cannot be gnyana they cannot be bhakti
14:31
then the four paths seem to be separate
14:36
but they're actually one sri aurobindo
14:42
says is the essence of the message of
14:44
the gita it is yeah he says it works
14:54
founded in wisdom so he says you can
14:57
start with works but eventually you'll
15:00
attain wisdom and when there's wisdom it
15:03
triggers this immense amount of love in
15:05
you if I remember right that's the
15:10
progression he was making that means I
15:18
got from reading essays on the Gita
15:21
wait and those are three windows
15:24
original thought those are from the
15:26
bhagavad-gita that we all Revere so much
15:29
in this in many other parts of the world
15:32
right so we we have a mission to
15:36
complete a new high to reach balance to
15:39
be found personally as a community and
15:42
as a species ours is just another
15:44
movement in the direction okay so this
15:50
was the thing so yeah back one minute
15:56
back when I made the poster I had this
16:01
long future express love and yield more
16:10
first line that's their word best when
16:13
you love absolute one minute you serve
16:17
God best when you love yes that was my
16:23
making a quote all by myself
16:25
oh if you've known me long enough a lot
16:30
of people have accused me of simply
16:32
borrowing other people's thoughts and
16:34
vomiting them without any change so yeah
16:42
learn he'll share express love and yield
16:45
more was originally inspired by Swami
16:49
Sivananda serve love give purify
16:52
meditate for life yeah right you can see
16:58
where he starts with the same thing
17:00
right service with a smile absent from
17:03
service you find love then giving
17:10
becomes a natural thing for you every
17:11
day right so random acts of kindness
17:15
random they need to be random they need
17:17
to be seemingly random because
17:19
everything goes by whose plan
17:25
with Lord know which which Lord these
17:30
are the large plant which Lord the
17:39
indwelling Lord or the Lord of lords the
17:43
the Jeevitha or the Paramatma I think
17:47
it's it's actually both okay page on the
18:05
topic of death so this is an example of
18:09
a page on yield mode you'll find the
18:16
menu on the right hand side is often
18:18
replaced with a list of all the pages of
18:21
this sub site they so depth when there's
18:26
more than one piece of content to it
18:28
evolves into a mini site and prayer
18:33
rebirth is actually the prayer that you
18:35
find on the poster something I wrote the
18:40
first time I got personally involved
18:42
someone's death someone's grandmother's
18:48
death rather and I've since lost my
18:52
mentor my the guy who tried instructing
18:57
me in the Quran 20 years ago and I've
18:59
lost my grandmother and since then I've
19:03
come to a more deeper meaning of the
19:06
feelings that you go through when you
19:07
lose someone right but the prayer was
19:10
really simple still as you say for all
19:14
the souls of people we've known and
19:16
loved may they have met the moment of
19:18
death that calm and peacefulness and
19:20
little or no discomfort pain or
19:22
trepidation may they have soon realized
19:25
that they had passed away from us and
19:27
not look back at us with sadness
19:29
attachment or regret maybe a short visit
19:32
to the world between lives be full of
19:34
courage acceptance and daring may they
19:37
not be lured into phantasmal
19:39
which are hard to come out of maybe not
19:41
be too harsh on themselves in judgment
19:43
of their past birth and their actions
19:45
their in May their time in purgatory or
19:48
heaven or hell be adequate and
19:49
productive may they choose wisely their
19:52
birth and be granted your grace so the
19:56
telling line is the last one which says
19:57
choose wisely their next birth yes which
20:01
is a belief I've come to hold after
20:04
going back and forth and reading and
20:07
talking about it over the years but
20:09
basically it's that we choose the strips
20:15
of our lives okay your soul carries
20:21
impressions from a previous birth based
20:25
on those impressions including
20:26
reflecting on your wrong actions you
20:29
come to say guys this is the cast for
20:31
the next play or the next iteration of
20:33
the play you choose you choose I choose
20:38
your parents you choose your friends you
20:41
choose your lover all this happens in
20:44
the background right but then there's
20:47
also collects a sermon so as a group of
20:50
friends something you did somewhere
20:53
means that one of you is going to have
20:55
to die in an accident so there's a
21:02
working or the whole karma which happens
21:04
from birth to birth but there's also
21:07
this new Karma where something
21:09
unexpected might happen to you which
21:10
changes everything I'm 50 now I was
21:16
actually supposed to live till I was 16
21:18
but something happened to change the
21:22
script for my son and I needed to
21:23
suddenly make an exit early in his life
21:26
and I would say so its core scripted
21:32
it's scripted by you it scripted by your
21:35
maker and it's also scripted by all the
21:38
people you bring in to act in for that
21:41
one play okay and if you want to see
21:46
details on this scripting process it's
21:49
the
21:52
they shine tree called up from the
21:55
Garuda Purana
21:56
which I aggressive as a forward
21:57
something X so I'll quickly go through
22:03
this please oh I got this in 2017 okay
22:08
number 2017 so what is death is there
22:11
life after death is it painful how does
22:13
rebirth happen where do we go after
22:15
death and all of that is answered here
22:18
there's an astral card which needs to be
22:21
severed before that I mean at the time
22:23
of death the physical body comes to an
22:27
end there's a detachment from the body
22:30
so here's the thing right the soul is
22:33
convinced that the main essence of its
22:34
survival is lost and that its body has
22:37
merged into the five elements the
22:40
experience is freedom but it goes around
22:42
visiting the place its life time based
22:48
on how attached it is to the things of
22:49
its birth please right then it goes
22:53
through a tunnel where it reaches the
22:54
astral plane is reunited with its
22:57
ancestors who are there but for me the
23:02
thing is you can meet all your ancestors
23:03
because half of them are already reborn
23:06
so are you meeting the old lady you
23:09
helped across the road because she is to
23:11
limper you know the astral plane or are
23:14
you meeting your dad because he's now
23:16
thirty year old who's you know about to
23:19
get married or something who are you
23:21
meeting really nice right or or when you
23:24
cross the astral plane does your father
23:27
who is now incarnated remember you as in
23:29
a dream that you wake up with a strange
23:32
feeling that he met all the things we
23:38
don't know right yes I was a meeting
23:41
meeting ancestors meetings people you've
23:44
known from your life connecting with
23:46
them which could be in it which would
23:48
manifest as a dream right a meeting on
23:50
the spiritual plane as we remember it
23:51
would be a dream for us anyway so that's
23:58
meeting the ancestors then you do a life
24:00
review this I like this there is no
24:03
judge there is no
24:04
the soul judges itself just the way you
24:07
were used to judging other people and
24:10
based on the judgment you pass on
24:13
yourself you are already drafting the
24:16
soup foil is like this okay so there is
24:20
a nice review and then there is a
24:24
blueprint where you create the script
24:29
for your next life
24:32
and then rebirth actually happens when
24:37
the rebirth happens is where you enter
24:40
your plane and the contract comes into
24:42
effect in a so that's why I asked you
24:46
who script all of creation is a part of
24:59
you thanks right so this is something
25:10
something I wanted to share I see now
25:14
let's go back give me yeah it's quite a
25:21
little time standing what it stands for
25:25
but let's go back to in sensual good
25:29
time why is he offended this receiver
25:33
right now five years even hold jobs
25:47
healthy or not still a passion
25:52
absolutely unhealthy sometimes but yeah
25:55
so basically for me that's what I
26:00
started earlier right I said we were we
26:03
were given this motto of service with a
26:04
smile and I was a kind of easy to
26:09
emotionally bond with easy to form likes
26:12
for people I mean easy to like people
26:15
and
26:22
then I hit college right an engineering
26:26
college I felt there was so much more we
26:28
could do for our students if we applied
26:32
ourselves right so there was this phase
26:36
of me which spoke of wanting to change
26:39
the way subjects were taught in college
26:41
and this and that
26:42
that was 2005-2006 I began working I've
26:52
been a programmer since since college I
26:55
mean since you are in college even right
26:58
so I can show you some of my electronic
27:01
stuff later I started electronic
27:07
standard I started computer science in
27:10
12 days programming in 12
27:14
I still like what I do but I'm slowly
27:17
trying to get into the non technical
27:19
part of England right what does he have
27:21
to offer us right now that's just 80
27:26
boring poems and about us
27:30
oh wait it's boring because it's my own
27:42
trip right some people read it and say
27:45
hey in the particle ilda and the
27:47
particle data stuff you know
27:49
okay there's a word for that it's a
27:51
humble bag it's you you reduce the thing
27:58
of what you've done
27:59
in the hope that someone will say no
28:01
it's better than that anyway so yeah
28:12
2005 I think I wrote tripping
28:25
I haven't any way tripping on our feet
28:33
was an article I wrote back in college
28:36
and it was talking about how we had to
28:41
combat brain drain oh we had to combat
28:47
this lack of proper application of our
28:50
engineers lack of saw first teaching all
28:53
of those things so that was my first
28:54
attempt at trying to change the system
28:57
[Music]
29:02
2007 I read a book called Leela which
29:08
talked about the divide between static
29:10
and dynamic quality so this I mean
29:15
stasis is static quality and the
29:18
individual in bubbly effervescence is
29:21
dynamic quality right and it took me a
29:26
whole three years to apply that divide
29:28
to religion and then my whole fight
29:30
against the system kind of stopped
29:33
I felt you needed both sides right
29:36
you needed two static because it serves
29:39
the purpose you need the dynamic because
29:41
it changes that purpose for the better
29:44
and it unfortunately the static has
29:50
become a little encrusted because of
29:53
hangovers from the dark ages as I call
29:55
them so there is one moment
30:13
if it's here it's here this is a
30:22
different thing one second static and
30:23
dynamic I was talking about the ages
30:27
right so when you look at this system
30:34
the system is carrying over eminence
30:36
from the dark ages okay we have
30:41
hangovers to rush out of our collective
30:43
consciousness we are rediscovering ways
30:46
to love one another which brings me back
30:49
to this revolution that took place in
30:51
the world in the 60s I've said it as
30:55
every decade since the 60s has shown us
30:59
grow in our ability to love and think of
31:01
the well-being of one another then I
31:06
realized not all of us not all the
31:09
time I think so literally we are we are
31:14
doing that there's enough there's enough
31:17
examples of us doing that that the rest
31:19
of us can take inspiration from you
31:22
right which which is where I start to
31:24
have my first rub with these doomsday
31:27
people who say that either the world is
31:29
going to end whatever right you don't
31:32
understand what it means to establish a
31:34
kingdom of heaven and when they say it
31:37
well I think we already had the we
31:41
already had the Holocaust I think of a
31:46
world those days and that I'm starting
31:52
to think what these people were
31:53
prophesying in religion thousand two
31:55
hundred thirty two thousand years ago
31:58
we've all seen more or less chaos in
32:01
modern day times there's people who say
32:06
that Kalki came and went so if we've had
32:15
200 modern day Saints in the last 500
32:18
years any one of them could have been
32:21
Kalki coming and going
32:27
hey I'm not allowed to tell you who it
32:30
was who claimed someone was Kalki but
32:32
just imagine right so if you have
32:35
someone who's come and gone and
32:36
somewhere in the last 300 years the edge
32:39
of n the period of enlightenment the
32:41
period of reason everything we've learnt
32:43
to love one another again then you're
32:46
living in blessed magical times you know
32:48
you're no longer living in the dark ages
32:49
you no longer living in the negativity
32:52
surrounded by hangovers from the dark
32:54
ages and these reflections of some of
32:59
this in some of my writing some of these
33:03
ideas right let's let's talk about some
33:12
things to do
33:16
release them we whether it be just
33:20
Facebook share or just people have a
33:22
conversation around you you see him soon
33:26
people are starting to have conversation
33:30
about aware is conversation about the
33:34
concerns of a pretty show you use it was
33:42
a very high priority
33:45
still talking about hey this is a shape
33:50
who reigns in universe so he was much
33:55
part of university miss you and over the
33:58
last few years
33:59
you seem like less you use that this
34:13
happening but that change is all around
34:15
you come into them that change is all
34:18
around us everything is perfect the main
34:22
plan and the divine plan has a promise
34:25
of a bright tomorrow absolutely
34:29
when a brave new world unfold beneath
34:31
the clear blue sky
34:33
I think I'm quoting things right right
34:36
now
34:37
but it's a brave new world one that we
34:40
have to healthy right there's a
34:44
gentleman who says let me see if I can
34:47
pull up that port quickly yeah this is
34:55
what he says right man's greatness is
35:00
not in what he is but in what he makes
35:02
possible his glory is that he is a
35:06
closed place and secret workshop of a
35:09
living labor in which super manhood is
35:11
made ready by a divine craftsman named
35:14
but he's admitted over yet greater
35:17
greatness and it is this that unlike the
35:19
lower creation he is allowed to be
35:21
partly the conscious artisan of his
35:24
divine change his free ascent his
35:27
consecrated will and participation are
35:30
needed that into his body may descend
35:32
the glory that will replace him and this
35:36
is from series of essays now called the
35:40
hour of God which the sheer window are
35:45
some published one of the last things I
35:49
put on my website I think you'll find it
35:53
at yield more a dog slash works you see
36:01
the hour of God over there okay so what
36:07
he says is if if the earth calls and the
36:10
supreme answers the moment can be even
36:12
no for the demons and glorious
36:14
transformation and that moment is now
36:22
all the internet did was accelerate that
36:24
process that collective working out of
36:27
collective karma Collective evolution
36:29
everything the internal is just super
36:31
accelerated it so now we're into hyper
36:33
hyper drive they're not circling the
36:37
brain like George Carlin would lead you
36:39
believe right he's just saying guys if
36:41
you don't control this if you don't go
36:43
in the right direction you could be
36:44
heading towards the train but you're not
36:45
you're doing wonderfully well
36:48
right so George Colleen say Aurobindo
36:51
two of those thinkers that feature on
36:54
the website right other websites so we
37:11
go back to Moodle page sorry then start
37:20
with this finish so can we cut it out so
37:23
yeah so this is the website it's a
37:27
wordpress multi-site installation that
37:31
means people here is the category and
37:33
sri aurobindo is a post right which is
37:37
why it says edit post at the top now
37:43
there are a bunch of different websites
37:45
which make up yield mode or dog
37:48
Shh if you want to see the entire site
37:51
map you just have to click on the left
37:53
half of the screen which I call universe
37:56
okay so if you look at the site map this
38:02
is all the content that's evolved over
38:04
the last five years this there's a few
38:07
books which have been mentioned some
38:09
interesting documentaries forum and
38:11
documentaries are the least added to
38:14
parts of the website the fountainhead
38:17
features Howard Roth's courtroom speech
38:19
for those who are interested
38:22
organizations can be featured here the
38:24
poems practices songs very interesting
38:29
songs here right so I say that arguably
38:32
and I want people to the challenges I
38:33
say these are the best 15 songs I've
38:35
heard in my life this and the criteria
38:44
for selection is how profound are they
38:46
how much of a message do they do and
38:49
what is they call to values right so if
38:54
you look at the song like the logical
38:55
song it's all about
39:02
what the system will make you if you
39:05
don't fight it and the system will try
39:08
to make your logical responsible and
39:10
practical and they'll blame you and call
39:16
you a fanatical if you say you're going
39:19
to be different from the other people
39:21
and all he says is tell me who I am
39:26
which is again throwing out the gauntlet
39:28
challenge
39:30
what will you always be what is it that
39:32
you want out of life okay that's one
39:37
example of a song there's another very
39:45
touching one called it all right here
39:49
and he says I read of men who traveled
39:55
flowers in themselves they seek the
39:58
light for their direction they spent the
40:02
whole life searching for that inner
40:03
space to bring them closer to perfection
40:09
now we may choose to journey high among
40:12
the stars I'll search the depths or
40:14
Astrogator but from our travels we will
40:18
come to realize that everything we
40:20
really need is here the picture of a
40:25
world already perfect in which all
40:28
that's required of you is to live from
40:30
moment to moment be the best possible
40:33
you that you can be which brings us back
40:36
to essentially loving the moment right
40:40
there's another musician who says
40:43
without love am half human I'm dying
40:47
without love
40:50
so Vidya Vidya Jyoti what Thomas Oh
41:00
Majorca Maya
41:04
lead me from ignorance and inertia into
41:07
light so hang on that brings us to
41:18
another part of the website the part
41:21
where mp3s can be published so I've
41:30
recalled the few trails this is one of
41:34
them this was actually the first one I
41:38
recorded as a Thomas Thomas Thomas Oh
41:42
majora Kamiya with your Mohammed uncle
41:44
Maya ohm shanthi shanthi shanthi Lord
41:48
keep me not in the unreality of bondage
41:51
to the phenomenal world but lead me
41:53
towards the reality of the eternal self
41:55
he's me not in the darkness of ignorance
41:57
but led me towards the light the light
41:59
of spiritual knowledge keeping us in the
42:02
fear of death due to bondage to the
42:04
mortal world but lead me towards the
42:06
immortality gained by knowledge of the
42:09
immortal self beyond death
42:11
actual meaning right so this is just
42:15
another fun thing I like to do is pray
42:21
all right so yield yeah okay that that
42:25
brings us to this guy so this is 2017
42:50
August 2015 it is the logo but it was
42:57
only in 2017 with the help of a friend
42:59
that I caught the color for this and by
43:02
then it had become inspire curate
43:04
promote publish so if you see
43:08
[Music]
43:11
this is how we looked in 2015 we look in
43:17
2017 and I think 2016 this is how we
43:27
look
43:29
hey interesting okay it's I'm glad to
43:36
see that you come here Luke it's a nice
43:38
and let's yeah includes your glasses see
43:44
and he needs it except improve time yeah
43:49
[Music]
43:56
this is the definition of yield more
43:58
right we are linked between people
44:02
organizations and movements showcasing
44:05
ideas that are really worth sharing
44:07
right so I don't want to be IMDB with 20
44:10
thousand movies listed I want to be the
44:12
cream of the cream the most
44:14
thought-provoking or emotionally
44:17
connecting ones are mentioned right I
44:21
was watching The Bridges of Madison
44:26
County with my mom last month
44:30
I said man here's a really cool movie he
44:37
captures a human element so well I'm
44:42
actually thinking you know guys maybe I
44:44
can share this with couples who are
44:47
facing hard times nice thing to say
44:51
sometimes a little bit of love you
44:54
receive even if it's from someone not
44:56
other than your spouse can go a long way
44:58
to help you go back to what you are
45:02
which is a married person with kids
45:04
without kids whatever but in the
45:06
relationships that you committed to to
45:08
be in for a very long time we don't just
45:11
marry idly right right so now that's
45:17
just an example so if you look at the
45:20
visiting card it says inspired curate
45:23
promoting publish nice so we're trying
45:27
to share ideas that inspire people in a
45:31
content has to be either inspiring or
45:33
useful right right and useful doesn't
45:37
always mean practical tips on how to
45:39
improve your carrier it could also be
45:41
useful in terms of what emotions you
45:44
want to wash over you to make you feel
45:46
connected with the universe because that
45:48
is what we are all connected with the
45:50
universe uses right so the best content
45:55
is not something we need to create it it
45:57
already comes it exists it's been there
46:01
in the Performing Arts it's been there
46:02
in classical music it's been there in
46:04
Carnatic music it's all about the
46:07
content we can cure it
46:08
so we're big on curation right openly
46:13
promoting the works of people who join
46:15
us people who we admire and finally
46:19
publishing so if you look at the works
46:24
we've published these are all of them so
46:30
I can go to the Mahabharata and as you
46:32
frame what's your favorite character
46:35
[Music]
46:37
remove anything put your favorite
46:39
character in the Mahabharata I actually
46:44
admire a person like oh okay I just have
46:53
to go there and hit Search nice so this
46:56
is on the publishing front right in one
46:59
sense I am publishing your article in
47:02
one sense I'm publishing three
47:04
publishing videos and publishing mp3s
47:06
but primarily I'm publishing works works
47:09
of literature that's how it started in
47:12
2005 I said I was trying to change the
47:17
system the educational system in 2008
47:21
yield more started as me wanting to
47:24
publish Sri Aurobindo savithri and it's
47:28
funny because in today's poem I've
47:31
actually spoken about savithri for the
47:33
first time
47:35
right do you have the poem I sent you he
47:39
said okay let's see how lucky we get
47:45
here okay I think you'll have to pull it
47:53
up
47:53
I don't remember uploading it hey go on
48:09
with the question stuff yes okay so I
48:29
have to bring it up at night it's nice
48:43

48:47
see that well good I said I have been
48:53
seeing them do apart from all the other
48:57
things that you you keep a lot of time
49:05
towards promoting freedom words can you
49:10
take that first promoting written words
49:16
very can work here inspiration through
49:19
words through work
49:21
yeah can you explain oh yeah I can so
49:26
what is your relationship I've been
49:29
reading all my life right so like for me
49:37
books are the window into the world okay
49:43
wait
49:45
music is a window into your soul
49:50
movies are the visual extension of books
49:55
the perfect marriage of visual story and
49:58
music right so if you really wanna if
50:04
you look at if you look at the home page
50:08
of yield mode it says that we're out
50:12
we're a close-knit network of people out
50:13

50:16
replenish your wheels and the link repin
50:20
if you're wise actually points to the
50:21
movies the pretty rating okay I think
50:28
there's nothing that can move you more
50:31
say a movie if you want the longer
50:36
version of it you go for a book thank
50:39
you and it makes p.m. sorry right
50:44
and if you want to be moved in three to
50:46
seven minutes go for a song ah
50:49
right so the question is what do you
50:51
want it yeah it's all about the stories
50:54
you paint them the stories you see in
50:56
the lives of people around you
50:58
that's what story you refine the craft
51:02
into a movie and you condense it into a
51:04

51:16

51:24
what what are some of Bryan Adams you
51:28
were young and wild and free right free
51:33
thinking right so I've had a love for
51:40
the spoken written word all my life
51:44
the some word I would say yeah the Sun
51:47
spoken and written word it's where we
51:51
draw inspiration from the world around
