      If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
      Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>
      If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you<br>
      But make allowance for their doubting too,<br>
      If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
      Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br>
      Or being hated, don't give way to hating,<br>
      And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:<br><br>
      
      If you can dream--and not make dreams your master,<br>
      If you can think--and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
      If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
      And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>
      If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br>
      Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
      Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
      And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:<br><br>
      
      If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
      And risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
      And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
      And never breath a word about your loss;<br>
      If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
      To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
      And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
      Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"<br><br>

      If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
      Or walk with kings--nor lose the common touch,<br>
      If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;<br>
      If all men count with you, but none too much,<br>
      If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
      With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,<br>
      Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,<br>
      And--which is more--you'll be a Man, my son!
