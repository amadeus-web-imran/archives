# Intents

Apart from [establishing YieldMore](../about-us/) with its projects and purposes and juggling a demanding full-time job, I have now a stated target of helping establish 20 individuals, businesses, charities and communities by the year 2025.

I use a mix of [my diverse skills](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ianamazi/) and network, and with a little help from [Amadeus](https://amadeus.yieldmore.org/), hope to collaborate with you on your projects / ideas to usher in a new world of hope and action.

# What I bring

 - 6 years of [electrical and electronics system design](https://cselian.com/imran/profiles/index.php)
 - 21 years of software system and website design
 - 15 years of IT experience
 - 8 years of ideation [YM](../matrix/)
 - 5 years of writing [IMRAN](https://imran.yieldmore.org/)

# What I'm worth

Valued by the IT industry at about 1250 an hour (INR) and upto 27/45$ USD, I've decided to work for a fraction of that on mine and your ideas for social development.

# Remuneration Proposal

For non IT consulting  and non pro bono work, I propose a simple retainer of Rs 6000/- per month. Monies to be paid in advance (or for the previous month) by the 5th of each month.

If there is a gross disparity between the expectation and the actual, in the interests of aiding both parties, I propose a simple halving of the charges, unless I decide to return more.

As my time is limited and I am best aided by a few other consultants and team players, I request that entire works are not made to hinge on me.
