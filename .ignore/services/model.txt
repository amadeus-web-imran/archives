<h1>Introduction</h1>

This page discusses the spirit in which an organization/community may be formed and will hopefuly become the blueprint for future conscious businesses.

I first outlined the RMI Framework in Dec 2012 when I was invited to build a Roster Manager for an american football league. That page is temporarily down as I struggle to find the time to import cselian.com/blog/ into Amadeus.

We then took that idea back to the drafting board in 2020 mid with #Panishq and are noW trying it in this new avatar Yield More Services.

<h1>Guidelines (for Team Collaboration)</h1>

Created with inputs from 2 friends back in October / November 2021, here's the skeleton of this model.

<h2>1. Effort x Value = Remuneration</h2>
for that Individual (for that type of work done). Ideas can have an initial value and it's value can be updated as the project enters predetermined phases. This value to be encashed at the end of each phase / pro rata at the time of parting ways.

<h2>2. Revenue - Operations = Income</h2>
If Income &lt; Remuneration, remuneration is paid first (in ratio of total value to efforts put in) until we are break even. This also, done monthly.

<h2>3. When Income > Remuneration</h2>
20% is kept for plough back (reserve) and remaining is distributed equally by all who are on the rolls, to be paid out every month.

<h2>4. Fully Committed</h2>
While this doesn't mean full time, and in some cases, persons may wish to remain anonymous, fully committed means they have spent atleast 2 weeks actively contributing and that is their "Date of Joining".

<h2>5. Parting Ways Without Dues (or retiring)</h2>
If 1 lakh is reserve at the time that someone wants out, we factor in months spent to arrive at an exit bonus. If 6 members "fully committed" have together spend X say 30 months with us and the person exiting has spend Y say 10 months with us, then X/Y or 10 / 30 of the reserve is paid out to him or her.

<h2>6. Commissions</h2>
To be paid for ideas / referrals / business development and may continue even after exit/retirement. With regards to ideas, continuance/percentage may depend on other's contribution to make it viable / whether it's still usable in it's initial form.

<h2>7. Not Break Even</h2>
At time of Parting Ways. Money to be paid within 6 months. Or half by 12 months, after which it is written off.

<h2>8. Expenses, Essentials and Advances</h2>
To be handled on a per case basis by majority vote of the entire team except the one requesting it. If deadlocked at 50% vote, the case is passed.

<h2>9. Recognition</h2>
This to accrue as "remuneration pending" based on worth of the individual's contribution / ideas.

<h2>10. Parting Ways before Payback</h2>
If X joins tomorrow and receives Y hours of training from the Team in total - they owe back that many hours billable / in exchange for their time, again in 6 or 12 months or written off same as the other Parting Ways clause.

<h2>11. Request to Leave</h2>
In case of a irreconcilable disagreement or a breach of ethics or non-performing, case is heard and if majority votes so, the person concerned will be asked to leave. Remuneration will still apply except for breach of ethics, and of course, payback too.

<h2>12. Originator of Idea</h2>
To have it copyrighted in his name and licensed to company, but he cannot simultaneously license it to any person or org who do not follow this same shared-by-all model. Further, he no longer receives commission if, after parting ways, he decides to license others.

<h2>13. Death</h2>
Nominee to continue receiving commission, remuneration accrued and to be given "Parting Ways" profit at time of 2 years from death of teammate after which, only commission (as per Clause 6) is due. Copyrights to go to nominee and they are invited to join in stead / nominate a replacement team member.

<h2>14. Cap Size and Spawning</h2>
At formation, a cap size is determined and as the org approaches half it's limit, it starts to think of spawning another org. Idea is to keep spawning orgs in this same shared-by-all model rather than grow to a massive size.
